/**
 * The guard on the invalidate door, and — just as load-bearing — the absence of a guard everywhere
 * else.
 *
 * <p>This service had no identity at all until the door landed, and the risk of adding one is not
 * that the door is under-protected. It is that the protection SPREADS. Three wire protocols here are
 * pulled anonymously by dockerd, npm and maven on qits-net, and a 401 on any of them is not a
 * message anyone reads: it is every client on the platform caching "this artifact cannot be had".
 * So the pair of claims below is the whole file — the DELETE refuses a caller without the role, and
 * the listings beside it still answer a caller with no identity whatsoever.
 *
 * <p><b>The dev-user fallback is blanked, which is what makes any of this observable.</b>
 * qits-auth-core ships a {@code %test} dev user carrying {@code qits:admin}, so under an ordinary
 * {@code @QuarkusTest} every request passes every {@code @RolesAllowed} before the annotation is
 * consulted — a guard test written without this profile passes whether the annotation is there or
 * not, which is the worst kind of green. Clearing {@code qits.auth.forward.dev-user} restores the
 * deployed posture: no header, no identity.
 *
 * <p>The happy path is asserted here only far enough to show the guard ADMITS — a {@code 404},
 * because nothing is cached at a made-up path in a suite that pulls nothing. What an admitted call
 * actually does is {@code maven.MavenCacheEvictionTest}'s subject, where there is an upstream to
 * refetch from.
